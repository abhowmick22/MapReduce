Distributed File System:
1. started from the namenode
2. contains the following:
	- A trie consisting of the file system structure
	- At each node in the trie is a directory; it also stores an array list of
	
Requirements from Admin for DFS:
1. Add datanode names and total number of datanodes in config file
2. 

Requirements from the client for DFS:
1. Client provides file upload path on DFS
2. Client provides DFS input and output paths for accessing files
3. A client can add files only to its own username. The username for a client is the machine name
that he is logged in from. ClientAPI checks whether the path of a file on DFS starts with "/dfs/username/"

Messages to NameNode:
1. "NewFile" - add new file to DFS; also send back to client api the names of the datanodes where to replicate

TODO:
1. Replicate only on nodes with less data on their disk, or with more processing power currently? Doing
the former right now.
