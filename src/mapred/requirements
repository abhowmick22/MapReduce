Functionality of the distributed processing framework
-----------------------------------------------------

1. JobTracker does the following tasks
	- Schedule jobs on the slave nodes
	- Run a monitor daemon to check the jobs on the slave nodes
	- re-execute jobs on the slave jobs in the event of failures
	
2. TaskTracker needs to run an RMI providing following services
	-
	
3. Task
	- assume we only get the dfs file path, and invoke a method at the master to 
	  get the local file system path
	- also, we run map/reduce tasks as services bound to a registry (this is the pool)
	
4. Implement a way for jobTracker to receive jobs from clientAPI

5. Assume jobTracker listens for messages from slaves on port 100
   and from clients on port 200
